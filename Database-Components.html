      <p>There are five main components of a database:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>
              <h3>Hardware</h3>
              <h4>The hardware consists of physical, electronic devices like computers, I/O devices, storage devices, etc. This offers the interface between computers and real-world systems.</h4>

          </li>

          <li>
              <h3>Software</h3>
              <h4>This is a set of programs used to manage and control the overall database. This includes the database software itself, the Operating System, the network software used to share the data among users, and the application programs for accessing data in the database.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h3>Data</h3>
              <h4>Data is a raw and unorganized fact that is required to be processed to make it meaningful. Data can be simple at the same time unorganized unless it is organized. Generally, data comprises facts, observations, perceptions, numbers, characters, symbols, images, etc.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h3>Procedure</h3>
              <h4>Procedure are a set of instructions and rules that help you to use the DBMS. It is designing and running the database using documented methods, which allows you to guide the users who operate and manage it.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h3>Database Access Language</h3>
              <h4>Database Access language is used to access the data to and from the database, enter new data, update already existing data, or retrieve required data from DBMS. The user writes some specific commands in a database access language and submits these to the database.</h4>
          </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Database Management System (DBMS)</h2>
      <p>
          Database Management System (DBMS)
          is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database.&nbsp;<br>The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and retrieve data.DBMS allows users to create their own databases as per their requirement.&nbsp;<br>The term “DBMS” includes the user of the database and other application programs. It provides an interface between the data and the software application.
      </p>

      <h1>Characteristics of Database Management System</h1>
      <h2>Provides security and removes redundancy<br><br></h2>

      <ol>
          <li><h2>Self-describing nature of a database system</h2></li>
          <li><h2>Support of multiple views of the data</h2></li>
          <li><h2>Sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing</h2></li>
          <li><h2>Insulation between programs and data abstraction</h2></li>
          <li><h2>DBMS allows entities and relations among them to form tables.</h2></li>
          <li><h2>It follows the ACID concept ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability).</h2></li>
          <li><h2>DBMS supports multi-user environment that allows users to access and manipulate data in parallel.</h2></li>
      </ol>
